## ![Logo](./public/favicon-32x32.png) Would You Rather - React Nanodegree Second Project

#### üìú Project Overview

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, we'll build a web app that lets a user play the ‚ÄúWould You Rather?‚Äù game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: ‚ÄúWould you rather [option A] or [option B] ?‚Äù. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven‚Äôt answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

#### üïπ Project Features

1. Login User
2. Register New User
3. View Answered & Unasnswered Poll
4. Participate in Poll Voting 
5. View Rank in Leaderboard
6. Route Protection
7. Route Redirecting

#### ‚õ≥Ô∏è Routes

**Route Gaurding** or **Route Protection** is in place for all routes, following is the route visibility:

| Normal User                | Authenticated User                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `/login` Login Route       | `/` Dashboard Route                    |
| `/register` Register Route | `/add` Create New Poll                 |
| `*` 404 Not Found          | `/leaderboard` Leaderboard             |
|                            | `/questions/:question_id` Poll Details |
|                            | `*` 404 Not Found                      |

**Route Redirecting** is in place. For example if user tries to visit `/leaderboard` directly from address bar without logging in then he/she will asked to login first and then redirected to initially requested route (`/leaderboard`)
